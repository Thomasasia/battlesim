  each soldier has hp, attack, defense, and number of attacks
  each archer also has ranged attack
  mages have ranged, do magick damage
  arty is ranged, damage penetration, aoe
  info for each type of soldier is in a json or smth

armies are made up of regiments
regiments are made up of lines
lines are made up of soldiers.

only the front line of the front regiment can engage in melee combat
each soldier gets an action. this can be a spell, ranged attack, or melee combat
actions happen simultaneously for each line in order from the front.

In melee, the front lines do combat. Each soldier is paired to another soldier(s), in proportion to the relative size of the lines.
  The max soldiers per soldier is 3 times the outnumberd soldier's size.

In ranged, the attack is made on a random soldier in a random line. Front lines are more likely to be targeted.

Each death requires adjacent soldiers to make a morale save, if failed that will decrement the total moralepool. at 0, the regiment will get a malus. at -50%, they flee

A soldier dying will reduce the morale pool by the proportion that they contribute to the max. This means that the moralepool is expected to go below zero as soldiers die, and would approach zero if all morale checks are made
